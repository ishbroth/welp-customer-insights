            <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 mb-4">
              <p className="font-semibold text-red-800">
                PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU
                AND WELP TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND IT LIMITS THE
                MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WELP.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>a. Choice of Law.</strong> These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the
              State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>b. Binding Arbitration.</strong> You and Welp agree that any dispute, claim or
              controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service
              (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except
              that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in
              small claims court; and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
              in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
              threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's
              copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual
              property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an
              "IP Protection Action"). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you
              will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide
              Welp with written notice of your desire to do so by email at
              arbitration-opt-out@welp.com within thirty (30) days following the
              date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-
              out Notice"). If you don't provide Welp with an Arbitration Opt-out
              Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you are deemed to have
              knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute
              except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive
              jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely
              provide Welp with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, any other Dispute
              will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California
              and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction
              and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Welp with an
              Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you are
              waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
              purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless
              both you and Welp otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not
              consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
              preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If
              this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this
              "Choice of Law, Binding Arbitration, and Dispute Resolution" section
              will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Choice of Law, Binding Arbitration, and Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>c. Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the
              American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the
              Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
              Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except
              as modified by this "Choice of Law, Binding Arbitration, and Dispute
              Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at
              www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The
              Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and
              enforcement of this section.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>d. Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must
              provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
              specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for
              Arbitration at www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778- 7879.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney
              licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected
              by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator
              within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then
              the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>e. Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless you and Welp
              otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county
              where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the
              arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents
              that you and Welp submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a
              hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If
              your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be
              determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the
              arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of
              information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of
              the arbitration.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>f. Arbitrator's Decision.</strong> The arbitrator will render an award within the
              time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will
              include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
              arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the award may be entered
              in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of
              damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Disclaimers and
              Limitations of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of
              damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may
              award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
              only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
              claimant's individual claim.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              <strong>g. Fees.</strong> Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses.

              <strong>h. Changes.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Changes to the

              Arbitration, and Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first

              Updated" date above or in the date of Welp's email to you notifying
              you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that

              with the provisions of this "Choice of Law, Binding Arbitration, and
              Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these
